2. **Update a Book**

   Endpoint: `/api/edit-book/:id`

   Description: `:id` needs to be passed as a query parameter. The request body can contain Title, Author, or Summary. At least one of the 3 is required to update the book.

3. **Get List of All Books**

   Endpoint: `/api/list`

   Description: Fetches the list of all books registered so far, including the total count.

4. **Get Single Book Content**

   Endpoint: `/api/book/:id`

5. **Delete an Existing Book**

   Endpoint: `/api/delete-book/:id`

   Description: `:id` is required for deleting a book from the database.

## Note

- The project doesn't use the MongoDB object id `_id` for editing, deleting, or getting data. Instead, a `book_id` is used as a user-friendly option.
- The `book_id` will be generated at the time of creating a new book. It will consider the last `book_id` number and increment the number for the new book.
